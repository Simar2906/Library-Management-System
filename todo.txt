Writing Applications in C# and .NET:✔
Create a new C# console application for the Library Management System.

Types of Data and Expressions:.✔
Define appropriate data types for representing a Book and a Library.

C# Language Constructs:✔
Implement the main menu with options for adding a book, viewing available books, borrowing a book, and returning a book.

Methods:✔
Create a method to add a new book to the library.

Method Overloading:✔
Implement an overloaded method to handle different scenarios for adding a book (e.g., with or without specifying the author).

Exception Handling:✔
Add exception handling to handle cases where incorrect inputs are provided during book addition.

Monitoring:✔
Implement a basic monitoring mechanism that logs each book addition to a file.

Structs:
Define a Date struct to represent the due date for borrowed books.

Enums:✔
Create an enum BookGenre to categorize books into genres.

Built-in Collections:✔
Use a List<Book> to manage the collection of books in the library.

Events:
Implement an event to notify when a book is borrowed or returned.

Creating Classes:✔
Create classes for Book and Library.

Interfaces:✔
Implement an interface, e.g., IBorrowable, to define methods for borrowing and returning books.

Understanding Generics in C#:✔
Utilize a generic collection (e.g., List<T>) to store books in the library.

Hierarchies of Classes:✔
Implement a base class Item and derive classes Book and Magazine from it.

Polymorphism:✔
Use polymorphism to handle borrowing and returning for different types of items.

Extending Classes:✔
Add additional properties/methods to the Book class, such as Author and DisplayInfo().

File I/O:✔
Implement functionality to save and load the library's state to/from a file.

Serialization and Deserialization:✔
Serialize and deserialize the library object to/from a binary file.

Streams:✔
Use streams to read and write data when saving/loading the library to/from a file.

Entity Framework:✔
Optional: Implement a simple database using Entity Framework to persist library data.

LINQ:✔
Use LINQ to filter and display books of a specific genre.
